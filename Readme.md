# smDynamicsAnalyzer

The smDynamicsAnalyzer is an open-source macro that can determine a series of dynamics parameters from the single-molecule tracking dataset simply by following the designated steps after building an appropriate folder structure.

Refer to the Ref 1 for the detailed instructions.
